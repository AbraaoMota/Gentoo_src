# Gentoo (source only)

This is a copy of the original repository for Gentoo (found at github.com/AbraaoMota/Gentoo), the semi-automated webapp vulnerability scanner. It is a Google Chrome extension created for my final year project.
This repository contains the source code only.
NOTE:
External libraries are required to be included as part of the code so that packaging the extension works appropriately

## Installation

In order to install:

1. Open Google Chrome, and visit `chrome://extensions` to manage your extensions
2. Ensure you have enabled "Developer Mode"
3. Press the "Load unpacked" button
4. Find the downloaded source code and select the `src` folder.
5. Gentoo should appear as a usable extension. To use it, make sure its toggle button is enabled.
